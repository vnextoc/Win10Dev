Neither do we! Looking for a reason to read books that you wouldn't ordinarily read? So are we. Do you enjoy sharing what you read with others in a lively discussion? We do, too. Our aim is to explore new intellectual territory, and then come together at a meeting and share what we found in our explorations. At this monthly book club meeting, we discuss any book on a particular theme. Themes in the past have been all over the map: mysteries, Japan, the economy, France, the decline of the middle class, short stories, and US spy agencies. <\/p> <p>This is the first of six meetings when we will be examining paradigms, how to see the paradigm we are in (which is a challenge, kind of like trying to pick up a rowboat when you are standing inside it), what goes on to change paradigms, and who some paradigm-shifters have been through history. Our goal is to read fascinating books each month, of course, but the overall path over 6 months is to be able to look at how we see the world from a new perspective. For our October meeting, we spend time with the American transcendentalists, who are fascinating people who changed our view of nature, who God is, and our relationship with God: Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Walt Whitman, Elizabeth Peabody, Bronson Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Emily Dickinson. Let's imagine what it would be like to have these folks chatting with us at our salon.<\/p> <p>In general, American Transcendentalism was a movement in nineteenth-century American literature and thought. It called on people to view the objects in the world as small versions of the whole universe and to trust their individual intuitions. We'll look at theses ideas, what these ideas replaced, and how these ideas became so pervasive that we can hardly imagine thinking otherwise.<\/p> <p>Here are some suggested books:<\/p> <p>Emerson, Thoreau, and the Transcendentalist Movement, by Ashton Nichols<\/p> <p>The Lives of Margaret Fuller by John Matteson<\/p> <p>The American Transcendentalists: Essential Writings, editor Lawrence Buell,<\/p> <p>The American Transcendentalists, their Prose and Poetry by Perry Miller<\/p> <p>The Essential Transcendentalists by Richard Geldard<\/p> <p>The Metaphysical Club by Louis Mennand<\/p> <p>American Transcendentalism by Philip Gura<\/p> <p>American Bloomsbury by Susan Cheever<\/p> <p>Emerson Mind on Fire by Robert Richardson<\/p> <p>William James In the Maelstrom of American Modernism by Robert Richardson<\/p> <p>Eden's Outcasts by John Matteson<\/p> <p>Before you make that trip to the library or your favorite source of e-books, to figure out what book to pull from the shelves or press 'buy' on Amazon, I encourage you to check your local public libraries. <\/p> <p>We'll meet at a member's house that is near the intersection of the 55, 73 and 405 freeways. There's plenty of street parking. The meeting will overlap with the dinner hour, so please bring a main dish, side dish, dessert, or drink to share, potluck style. I'll send out directions and a contact phone number twice in the week before the event to people who RSVP 'yes'. The discussions are always lively and engaging, and we tend to finish by 9 pm. <\/p> <p>Next month: Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, etc.<\/p>"",""how_to_find_us"":""I'll be in the kitchen doing last-minute slicing and dicing."",""event_url"":""http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/bookclub-794\/events\/225601780\/"",""yes_rsvp_count"":13,""name"":""Salon with American Transcendentalists (Month 1 of Looking at Paradigm Shifting)"",""id"":""225601780"",""time"":1446429600000,""updated"":1445117287000,""group"":{""join_mode"":""open"",""created"":1179277575000,""name"":""A Not-So Hardcore, Deep and Funny Bookish (Not Book) Club"",""group_lon"":-117.87000274658203,""id"":502474,""urlname"":""bookclub-794"",""group_lat"":33.630001068115234,""who"":""Deep and Funny Thinkers""},""status"":""upcoming""},{""utc_offset"":-28800000,""venue"":{""zip"":""92660"",""country"":""us"",""city"":""Newport Beach"",""address_1"":""2414 Vista Del Oro"",""name"":""The Bluffs Fiesta Room"",""lon"":-117.877449,""id"":5515882,""state"":""CA"",""lat"":33.639362,""repinned"":false},""headcount"":0,""distance"":0.7772944569587708,""visibility"":""public"",""waitlist_count"":0,""created"":1419728738000,""maybe_rsvp_count"":0,""description"":""<p>Every Monday Morning from 7:00am (Sharp) to 8:30am<br\/>Get there a few minutes early to say hi and find your seat!<\/p> <p><b>Our regular meetings are attended by between 20 and 25 members and guests, not all members are on meet up.<\/b> <\/p> <p>Join us to Master Your Communication and Leadership Skills<br\/>- Build your confidence<br\/>- Present your ideas effectively<br\/>- Expand your career and personal opportunities<\/p> <p>We are a President’s Distinguished business oriented public speaking club that meets in Newport Beach.<\/p> <p>Mission: <\/p> <p>We provide a supportive and positive learning experience in which members are empowered to develop communication and leadership skills, resulting in greater self-confidence and personal growth.<\/p> <p><a href=\""http:\/\/youtu.be\/HOxb87ZHI9c\"">Meet our Members!<\/a><\/p> <p>Get Comfortable with Tech Tools – Projector\/Powerpoint\/Microphone<\/p> <p>Visit as our guest anytime – no RSVP necessary!<\/p> <p>Help us celebrate our 40th year in 2014!<\/p> <p>We look forward to meeting you soon!<\/p>"",""how_to_find_us"":""Park along the basket ball court side of the Temple we are in the center building library."",""event_url"":""http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Newport-Center-Toastmasters\/events\/226030401\/"",""yes_rsvp_count"":4,""duration"":5400000,""name"":""Newport Center Toastmasters Meeting"",""id"":""wwshdlytpbdb"",""time"":1446476400000,""updated"":1419728738000,""group"":{""join_mode"":""open"",""created"":1408833260000,""name"":""Newport Center Toastmasters"",""group_lon"":-117.87000274658203,""id"":16564992,""urlname"":""Newport-Center-Toastmasters"",""group_lat"":33.630001068115234,""who"":""Speakers""},""status"":""upcoming""},{""utc_offset"":-28800000,""headcount"":0,""distance"":0,""visibility"":""public"",""waitlist_count"":0,""created"":1444150189000,""maybe_rsvp_count"":0,""description"":""<p>Come one come all, the more the merrier!

We'll start off with 5-nights on Bora Bora. We will fly on prop planes soon after we land in Papeete.Our stay here is at a great hotel called <a href=\""http:\/\/www.hotelmaitai.com\/\"">Mai Tai Hotel.<\/a>We've brought several groups here as well and it's just perfect. Most people will get oceanview rooms (sign up early to guarantee<b>) <\/b>but again, you may also upgrade at this hotel to beachfront or over-water bungalows as well. It’s the perfect location where we are able to walk to several restaurants in the neighborhood rather than depend on the resort. Yes, Bora Bora and Moorea CAN be expensive, but done right, where you can walk to local restaurants, it is no more expensive than home. Well have more great tours planned here as well, including a 4-wheel drive tour, a wave runner tour, snorkeling circle island tour, scuba diving and more.<\/p> <p><img src=\""http:\/\/photos1.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/5\/3\/600_434941875.jpeg\"" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nBora Bora, an island that is completely magical. Undoubtedly the most celebrated island in the South Pacific, Bora Bora is French Polynesia's leading lady. Her beauty is unrivaled and her fame, unwavering. Bora Bora is one of the few places on earth that everyone hopes to witness in their lifetime—and once you see it, you are forever enamored. The inevitable love affair with this island begins right before you touch down. The view from the plane window is a moment you will not soon forget. Have your camera in hand as you begin your descent and prepare for the moment when iconic Mount Otemanu comes into view. From that point on, each experience will only continue to exceed even your highest expectations. Once seen, Bora Bora is never forgotten. From the day you arrive until the moment you part ways, you will be in awe of how her soaring mountain peaks, turquoise lagoon and luxuriant overwater bungalows somehow look even more spectacular than the pictures.<\/p> <p><b>Next up - 5-nights <\/b>on Moorea. This is a small island that is mostly unchanged over the last 50 years. It's quaint pensions and cute restaurants, palm trees that dip over the water and the dreamy, multi-hued water in the lagoons that the reef protects. We’ve been given an<b> incredible group discount <\/b>at the beautiful Pearl Resort, a truly <b>upscale, 4-star resort<\/b> situated in a picturesque setting with an<b> infinity pool,<\/b> white sand beach and <b>over-water bungalows.<\/b> We've stayed here many times now and everyone always loves it.  Check out <a href=\""http:\/\/www.spmhotels.com\/resort\/moorea\""><a href=\""http:\/\/www.spmhotels.com\/resort\/moorea\"" class=\""linkified\"">http:\/\/www.spmhotels.com\/resort\/moorea<\/a><\/a>  to take a look.<\/p> <p><img src=\""http:\/\/photos3.meetupstatic.com\/photos\/event\/7\/7\/4\/600_434941908.jpeg\"" \/><\/p> <p>\n\n\nThere’s plenty of great sightseeing and tours to do in Moorea including <b>scuba diving<\/b> and their famous shark feeding,<b>snorkeling with sting rays<\/b>, dolphins and whales, visiting off-shore motu’s (small islands), <b>4-wheel jeep safari,<\/b> motor<\/p> <p>scooter rentals where you can ride around the whole island or just relaxing by the pool. Tahiti is not as expensive as some people might have heard either, as long as you know how to do it.

Once you sign up we will email out a price sheet for the upgrades. All have air conditioning, television and mini bar. The bungalows offer their<b> own private plunge pool! <\/b> We also have If you’ve always fanasized about staying in an over-water bungalow, this is your best chance with our group discount.

This is another very nice hotel called Manava with a great view back on the island of Moorea. There's some local fresh seafood walking distance from our hotel that we'll take you to.<\/p> <p>We’ll be <b>flying non-stop<\/b> (just 8-1\/2 hours) from LA to Tahiti on Tuesday night to spend a very full 11-days in paradise returning the evening of November 29th. This trip takes place over Thanksgiving week which should help many of you justify the time away from work.

In 874, Godai Hall was built at the top of the mountain by Buddhist monk Shobo. Later, the garan (main complex), small buildings, and five-story pagoda were constructed at the foot of the mountain.
